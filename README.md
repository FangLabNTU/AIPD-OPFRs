**AIPD-OPFRs: Flame Retardant Prediction Model**

AIPD-OPFRs is a flame retardant prediction model designed to predict the flame retardancy of compounds based on their SMILES representation. It utilizes a prediction script to generate predictions for compound flame retardancy.

**Usage**

To use AIPD-OPFRs, simply input the SMILES representation of the compound into the provided prediction script.
